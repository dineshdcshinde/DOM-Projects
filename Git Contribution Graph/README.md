# DOM Practice Project

This repository contains a simple yet effective DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation project aimed at enhancing your skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The project dynamically generates a Flex of 365 colored squares, each representing a day, with colors assigned randomly from a predefined palette inspired by GitHub's contributions graph.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: To provide hands-on practice with DOM manipulation and styling techniques.
- **Outcome**: A visually appealing, randomly colored Flex that mimics a contributions heatmap.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Creation**: Generates 365 squares programmatically using JavaScript.
- **Randomized Colors**: Assigns colors to squares from a predefined palette.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes modern CSS for clean and adaptive layouts.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Observe the Flex of squares rendered dynamically, with each square showcasing a random color.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Provides styles for the layout and Flex elements.
- **JavaScript**: Contains the logic for creating and styling the Flex elements.

## Technologies Used
