# Random Color Generator

This project dynamically generates cards with random background colors and their corresponding hexadecimal codes. Designed to demonstrate efficient DOM manipulation techniques, it includes functionality for copying hex codes directly to the clipboard upon user interaction.

## Key Features

- **Randomized Color Generation**: Dynamically creates cards with random background colors, displaying their hex codes prominently.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can click on any card to copy its hex code to the clipboard seamlessly.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Elements are generated, styled, and appended dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Responsive Layout**: A modern design that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Learning Objectives (Grasp Thing)

This project serves as a hands-on learning opportunity for core DOM manipulation concepts, including:

- **Dynamic Element Creation**: Using JavaScript to create and append elements programmatically (`document.createElement`, `appendChild`).
- **Event Handling**: Adding interactive behavior to elements with `addEventListener`.
- **Clipboard API Usage**: Implementing `window.navigator.clipboard.writeText` for effortless copying of text.
- **Style Manipulation**: Dynamically updating element styles via JavaScript.
- **Randomization Logic**: Generating unique hexadecimal color codes.
